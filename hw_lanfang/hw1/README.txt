Part 1)
a) Acceptable behaviors in solving homeworks/projects:

- Talking to my classmates about the problems
- Asking the course staff for help

- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- sublime

c) The late submission policy:
- Each student has 4 late days of which only 1 can be used per HW
- Students need to get an approval before submitting an assignment late

d) After making a late submission by pushing your code to Gihub you should:
- Complete the online late submission form
- Start the next HW sooner

e) Is there a grace period to submit assignments:
- NO

Part 2)
a) Git user interfaces are accepted and supported in this course:
- terminal (Mac or Linux)

b) Provide the appropriate git command to perform the following operations:
   1) Stage an untracked file to be committed. The file is called 'hw1q2b.cpp':
 git add hw1q2b.cpp
   2) Display the details of the last three commits in the repository:
 git log -p -3   

c) Let's say you staged three files to be committed. Then, you ran the following command:
git commit
What will git do?

- By running the following command, you are effectively finalizing the file in github. Now it would appear as a new file in github or as a new update to its previous version.

Part 4)
A correctly parenthesized expression is:
-An empty string is a correctly parenthesized expression
-A single character is a correctly parenthesized expression
OR 
-If P is a correctly parenthesized expression then PP is also a correctly parenthesized expression
-If Lp is a left parentheses and Rp is a right parentheses and P is a correctly parenthesized expression then LpPRp is a correctly parenthesized expression 
-If Lb is a left parentheses and Rb is a right parentheses and P is a correctly parenthesized expression then LbPRb is a correctly parenthesized expression
