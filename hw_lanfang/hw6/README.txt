HOMEWORK 6 BREAKDOWN

   I use a makefile for the crawler application inside 
the crawler directory. To run type:
make
./bin/search nameOfConfigFile.txt

   Initially I had the crawler running alongside the 
search engine in the search engine directory until someone 
told me they need to be stand alone applications. To 
avoid issues with the second main in the same directory,
I made two seperate directories (the searchengine directory
includes my pageranking part). Both work well, just 
wanted to be clear on my intentions.
